## About
LaunchCode provides and inclusive and supportive community to help get you
started on your first large open source project. 

This project is called Collab-Blog, and is a blog site where fellow LaunchCoders can
share blog posts that cover a wide range of topics. Similar to [Medium](https://medium.com/),
Collab-Blog allows users to create new blogs and share them with other users!
Collab-Blog is a full stack web application written in 
Angular, Spring Boot, and MySQL. 

## Your Task
You are going to help us build this project! We have written many [user stories](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/project/user-stories.html?highlight=user%20story)
that you will help us complete. So first, let's give you a lay of the land. 
1. Navigate to [Issues](https://github.com/LaunchCodeLiftoffProjects/Collab-Blog/issues). There you will see 
a few labels that we will use to give you an idea of what to expect with each Issue:
- Picture of all the labels

2. Read through all the issues to get a good idea of what you'd like to 
tackle based on your interest and skillset. For your first contribution, we recommend you
trying out a 'good first issue' tag. 
3. Reach out to John or Nick through slack (link to each of our profiles) letting us know
that you'd like to start working on it. 
4. We will assign you the task and you can begin working on it. 

## How to get started
